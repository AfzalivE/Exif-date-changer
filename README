Requirements:
- pyevix2 http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/
- datetime (comes with python 2.7)
- re (regexp library, comes with python 2.7)
- dircache (comes with python 2.7)

I don't know how to compile pyevix2 for Windows 64-bit but you can get it for other platforms (win32, linux32, linux-64...for linux use the ppa provided on their website)

This python script changes the following properties of an image file using the pyexiv2 library:

Exif.Image.DateTime
Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal
Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized

The file name has to be in the following format to be processed correctly:

2000 01 31 23 45 55.jpg

where:
- 2000 is the year
- 01 is the month
- 31 is the date
- 23 is the hour (in 24 hr format of course)
- 45 is the minute
- 55 is the second


Specify the folder in which the target files are placed (in either Windows or Linux) in the variable called PATH.
